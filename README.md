- Set target temperatures for thermostats
- Change thermostat modes
- Configure update intervals for thermostat data
- Simple installation and configuration

Or:

- Open HACS
- Search for "ESI Thermostat"
- Click "Download" button and install repository in HACS

## Manual Installation

### 1. Download the repository

Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeclanSC/hass-esi-thermostat.git
```

### 2. Install the integration

Copy the esi_thermostat folder to your Home Assistant custom_components directory:

> config/custom_components/esi_thermostat/

Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.

### 3. Configure the integration

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to **Settings** > **Devices and services** > **Add Integration**
2. Search for **ESI Thermostat**
3. Enter your ESI account email and password
4. Optionally, set the refresh interval to control how frequently the thermostat data is updated

## Usage

Once configured, a climate entity will be created for each connected room thermostat, or a water heater
entity for each programmable cyclinder thermostat. These entities allow you to:

- Set the target temperature
- Monitor the current temperature
- Change thermostat modes


## Notes and Troubleshooting

- This integration has been tested with the **ESCTP5-W** programmable cylinder thermostat.
- It is derived from work to support **ESI 6 Series** thermostats, so it is hoped, but untested that they still work.
- Other detected devices will appear as climate entities by default, but are unlikely to work as expected.
- If the integration does not function as expected, check the Home Assistant logs for errors.
- Verify that your ESI credentials are correct.
- If you encounter authentication errors, ensure that your email and password are entered correctly.
